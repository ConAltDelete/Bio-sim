animal module

Indroduction
------------
This file stores all of the animal classes that can be simulated. If you want to simulate another animal that is not here, it must inherite from the ``animal superclass``. Any global function not inside a class must contain ``__`` at the beginning or/and the end of the function.

Usage
-------
To create a new class you must inherate it from the animal class and leave it in ``animal.py`` module. 
.. automodule:: biosim.animal
