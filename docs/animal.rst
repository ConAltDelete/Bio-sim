animal module
=============

Indroduction
------------
This file stores all of the animal classes that can be simulated. If you want to simulate another animal that is not here, it must inherite from the ``animal superclass``. Any global function not inside a class must contain ``__`` at the beginning or/and the end of the function.

Theory
======
The animals has a few common traits:
 - birth
 - death
 - ageing
 - moveing
 - loss of weight

With these traites they can do want animals normaly do, not kung fu. 


Usage
-------
To create a new class you must inherate it from the animal class and leave it in ``animal.py`` module. 


.. automodule:: biosim.animal
