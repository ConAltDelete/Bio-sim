animal module
=============

Introduction
------------
This file stores all of the animal classes that can be simulated. If you want to simulate another animal that is not here, it must inherit from the ``animal superclass``. Any global function not inside a class must contain ``__`` at the beginning or/and the end of the function.

Theory
======
The animals has a few common traits:
 - birth
 - death
 - ageing
 - moving
 - loss of weight

With these traits they can do want animals normally do, not kung fu.


Usage
-------
To create a new class you must inherit it from the animal class and leave it in ``animal.py`` module.


.. automodule:: biosim.animal
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
