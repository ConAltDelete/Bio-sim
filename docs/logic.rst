============
logic module
============

introduction
------------
This module handles all of the logic in the simulation. The logic is used to make sure that everything runs like clockworks.

Usage
--------
Every season requires a ``Cells`` object to manipulate. The only exceptions are
   - ``season_end``
   - ``season_migration``

Those require the entire map.
